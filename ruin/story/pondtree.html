	        The path breaks down to an overgrown trail through the trees, you wonder if you have really been led the right way..
	        <br/>
	        You sit under an old tree, its roots twist into a clear cool stream. You feel at home here.
	        <br/><br/>
            You notice an old tent in the grass, someone must have come this way before.
            <br/><br/>
            <a href="dream.html" target="main">Pitch the tent</a>
