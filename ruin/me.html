            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <h4>
                This website is a “virtual ruin” containing aspects of the internet that have become a ruin over time.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Ruins in this case refer to any part of the internet that has been forgotten, is no longer relevant, or is just plain outdated. Ruins in real life require a physical location that has survived in a state of decay. However, everything on the internet survives in one way or another, be it through the many public and private internet archives, or through screenshots hosted on someone else's site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything on the web is connected. That was the whole point of its creation. Therefore, everything on the internet is influenced by everything else.
            </p>
            <p>
                As soon as something on the internet loses relevancy, it will forever remain on the web as a ruin, and its influence will continue to be passed on as the web evolves and changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                While exploring this virtual ruin, try and imagine what modern aspects of the internet were influenced by it. Sometimes we'll tell you, but often the answer is much more subtle and open to interpretation.

            <h3>INSPIRED BY - GeoCities!</h3>
            <p>
                In the mid-90s, far before the internet was mainstream and during the days of AOL and Netscape Navigator, a duo of internet entrepreneurs started a company they named Beverley Hills Internet, a fairly straightforward web hosting service for small and local businesses, that also offered around 15 megabytes of free hosting space, as a way to have some fun and attract new customers. Such an idea was not unheard of at the time, however what made Beverley Hills Internet important was the way in which they set the hosting up. Instead of simply allocating some web-space in an anonymous corner of the internet, they decided to partition their free service into multiple virtual “neighborhoods,” where each neighborhood hosted a different theme, and when users signed up they could choose which one they wanted their website to belong to, for example the Hollywood neighborhood for fan and celebrity sites, or Area51 for science fiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having your website hosted in a neighborhood meant becoming a part of that community, and one could easily browse a directory of other sites that “lived” next door, leading to the service’s renaming of GeoCities, following this motif.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, GeoCities became so popular that it was acquired by Yahoo! in a multi-billion dollar deal, only to be shut down 10 years later in 2009, due mainly to a loss of web traffic from a new generation of social networks like Myspace and Facebook, <u>themselves an evolution of the very idea that GeoCities had helped to create.</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                This site, like much of the modern web, is heavily influenced by those “ruins” once hosted on GeoCities.com and sites like it.
