	                </p>
	                <p>
		                Im really pleased with the way people have responded to this site. I hope it inspires you to make your own things.

	                </p>
	                <p>
		                Ok I checked, I still have a reflection so yes Im not dead! I had finals, which I passed Yay me! And now Im working on a secret project..

	                <p>
		                Id tell you more about it, but I might give up and look like a right goof, so Ill just say, I MIGHT launch a cool thing in a few weeks... ;)

	                <p>
	                	Something that worries me is how this site will survive in 10-100 years time, Id like to think it would be here even if I got hit by a bus tomorrow.
	                </p>
	                <p>
		                With that in mind, all music and videos that depended on youtube have been replaced with on site media! It may be a little slower perhaps but in years to come when youtube fails, melonland will continue on!

	                <p>
	                	Hi everyone! Its been a month since my last update. As usual I was actually just lazy, but I also have a big new thing! 
						<br/>A brand new VR section to the site! At least its a 3D section, I have not yet figured out how to get it on a VR headset.
	                </p>
	                <p>
						The world is changing people! And while the 2d web is lovely, I think we can do better, and I sure plan to try!
					</p>
					<p>
						This new section will be both about exploring and showing off 3D stuff. I think already I can see potential for doing things that were really not possible before. Its very exciting to have a whole new platform to create while still adding to this site!
					</p>
					<p>
						Its quite simple for now but that will change &gt;:D Give it a go here! <a href="vr/index.html" >3D HYPER PORTAL LINK</a>

	                </p>
	                <p>
		                There is no end yet, Ill add one some day, but give it a try if you like!

	                	Hello humans! Its been a while since I updated, Iv been quite lazy.
	                	College started again and thats a thing, its somewhat better this term, though I have a test this week so maybe it will seem worse after that!
	                	<br/>
	                	Iv cleaned up the homepage, it was loosing touch with its roots man, added some glow stars to the top so you remember your a star ;D
	                </p>
	                <p>
		                Do you ever wonder if this were your last update, what would the world remember you by, I like to hope every update to this site is one Id be proud to call the last, though I hope its not!
	                </p>
	                <p>
		                Anyway, enjoy the site, drop a note in the guestbook, I always like to know when people have dropped by.
