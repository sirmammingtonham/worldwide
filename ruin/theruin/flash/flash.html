                Flash games used to be widely popular in the early 2000s-2010s, since they were free and playable directly through your web browser, requiring no additional download. Websites such as <a class="link" href="https://armorgames.com/" target="_blank">Armor Games</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.miniclip.com/games/en/" target="_blank">Miniclip</a> were bookmarked for seemingly every kid and teenager with internet access.

                However, the advent of mobile devices made flash games all but obsolete. Mobile games were more convenient, portable, often didn't require internet access, and still featured the same simple yet addicting gameplay that made flash games so popular.
