            You just entered a portal to another dimension! Are you sure you want to keep going?
            <br/><br/>
            You see a garden. It is wet and grey, no one has been here in many years, an old iron gate sits at the end of the dusky lawn.
            <br/><br/>
            It leads to the woods.
            <br/><br/>
