				<h1>Blinky, Flash and Glow's Story</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The light's name is Charlie, but unfortunately he thinks that he is three people. Charlie has schizophrenia,  
					so he has multiple split personalities. Charlie is always having a fight with
					himself as his personalities NEVER agree. Charlie is lucky that he is such a nice looking light because otherwise 
					he would be buried in the dump because of his excessive arguing while
					people try to watch TV! Charlie's personalities are very different which causes a lot of conflict. Blinky is a light 
					that enjoys his job immensely, brightening up a room is his favourite 
					thing to do. Flash is confident, always happy and very insulting, his favourite thing to do is to make Glow depressed. 
					Glow is a sad light that hates his own glow ironically, he hates 
					Blinky and Flash. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Although realistically everything I said about Flash, Blinky and Glow is not real as they only exist in Charlie's messed up head.
